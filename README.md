## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
-  Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
-  Search for relevant shows on all pages

### Expected Behaviour

-  :heavy_check_mark: General
   -  :heavy_check_mark: The navigation menu should be fixed to the left for larger screens. Use the "Desktop - Home" page in the design as a visual reference.
-  :heavy_check_mark: Home
   -  :heavy_check_mark: The trending section should scroll sideways to reveal other trending shows
   -  :heavy_check_mark: Any search input should search through all shows (i.e. all movies and TV series)
-  :heavy_check_mark: Movies
   -  :heavy_check_mark: This page should only display shows with the "Movie" category
   -  :heavy_check_mark: Any search input should search through all movies
-  :heavy_check_mark: TV Series
   -  :heavy_check_mark: This page should only display shows with the "TV Series" category
   -  :heavy_check_mark: Any search input should search through all TV series
-  :heavy_check_mark: Bookmarked Shows
   -  :heavy_check_mark: This page should display all bookmarked shows from both categories
   -  :heavy_check_mark: Any search input should search through all bookmarked shows
